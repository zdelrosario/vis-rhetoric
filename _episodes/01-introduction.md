title: "Day 1: Introduction"
teaching: 25
exercises: 20
questions:
- "What's the big picture?"
- "How do visualization and rhetoric relate?"
- "How do we productively criticise graphs?"
- "How do we construct an argument with data?"
objectives:
- "Learn the visual hierarchy"
- "Learn the modes of persuasion"
- "Identify rungs on the visual hierarchy"
- "Use visualization principles for productive criticism"
keypoints:
- "The data-usage pipeline organizes our course content."
- "Data visualization can engage logos, ethos, and sometimes pathos."
- "The rungs of the visual hierarchy give us language for productive criticism."
- "First we find the true story in the data, and then we communicate it persuasively."

## The Big Picture
Figure 1 illustrates the *data-usage pipeline*; the full lifecycle of wrangling,
understanding, and communicating data. This is the framework for the entire
class.

| ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Wrangle     | Import    | Import data into programming environment |
|             | Tidy      | Reshape the data into a usable format    |
| Understand  | Transform | Perform numerical operations on data     |
|             | Visualize | Create graphical displays of data        |
|             | Model     | Construct a statistical model of data    |
| Communicate | Target    | Determine audience and message           |
|             | Empathize | Identify audience perspective and align  |
|             | Evaluate  | Deliver the message and gather feedback  |

## Principles
In class, we covered a few introductory principles:

- Visual
  - Use higher rungs on *the visual hierarchy* for numerical variables
  - **But**, always design for your intended purpose
- Rhetorical
  - Providing evidence for an argument improves your credibility (ethos)
  - Providing evidence for an argument is a key part of logic (logos)
  - *Consider* using an emotional appeal (pathos)

## Grading
There are several assignment types in this class, which will be graded on
different bases:

| Assignment Type | Grading Basis | Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daily | Completion | 60% |
| Challenge | Rubric | 10% |
| Spotlight | Completion | 5% |
| Deep Dive: Draft | Rubric | 5% |
| Deep Dive: Peer review | Rubric | 5% |
| Deep Dive: Presentation | Rubric | 10% |
| Deep Dive: Feedback* | Rubric | 5% |

Yes! You will be *graded* on the *quality of feedback* you give other students!
